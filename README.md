# 3-column-preview-card-component
My solution to the 3 Column Preview Card Component from Frontendmentor.io

First, I did the HTML markup and then styled the HTML for mobile devices. It was a simple task as the mobile style didn't require any complex styling to place them under eachother.

Then, I used media query for wide screens. The task is to set the 3 cards in a column, so I used the super awesome CSS Grid property and now the 3 cards are aligned horizontally in a column for wide screens. üòÅ
